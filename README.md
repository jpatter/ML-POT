Use IBM’s Data Science Experience (DSX) and BlueMix cloud services to create a working cloud-based application from start to finish.  Participants will be led through a series of three labs that build upon one another so it is important that they are completed in order.

1. [Lab-1](Lab-1) - The first lab will begin with loading data about the Titanic disaster and using machine learning to predict survivors with a Jupyter notebook in DSX with python.

1. [Lab-2](Lab-2) - The second lab will leverage Watson Machine Learning (WML) on the Titanic data to create categorical predictions using muliple models using the DSX Model GUI.

1. [Lab-3](Lab-3) - The final lab will guide participants in created a Principal Component Analysis model (PCA).   Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. PCA is mostly used as a tool in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It's often used to visualize genetic distance and relatedness between populations.

## Instructions:

### Step 1. Sign up for the IBM Data Science Experience (DSX).   We recommend using the Firefox browser.

__NOTE__: If you already have a DSX account, please skip to __Step 2__.

#### Create an account.

1.  Go to [http://datascience.ibm.com/](http://datascience.ibm.com/)

2.  Click the Sign Up button on the top right

### Step 2. Create a project

1. Click on Projects > View All Projects to see a list of your projects. You should only see a default project.

2. Click on the New project icon on the top right of the project list.

3. Type a name for your project. For instance, "DSX Lab". A Spark service and an object storage will be automatically selected as well as a container with a default name. A container is a directory on the object storage. Click on Create.
